# Image encryption is a crucial aspect of digital data security since many aspects of the weakness found in traditional encryption methods like AES and RSA, especially high computational time and resource-intensive operations, especially with large image datasets, have been discovered. This project investigates whether chaos-based encryption schemes are suitable for image encryption in terms of performance evaluation and security analysis, to ascertain the optimum chaotic maps for encryption. The project applies performance evaluation and security analysis to determine the most appropriate chaotic maps used in the proposed cryptosystem. Performance evaluation uses entropy and histogram analysis. Key sensitivity analysis is undertaken on a given image to carry out the security analysis. It makes use of three chaos map algorithms for both encryption and decryption. Specifically, it evaluates the Arnold Cat Map, Henon Map, and Logistic Map for its chaotic behavior, complexity, and pseudo-randomness. In this computational analysis, the project intends to showcase the great randomness brought into the cipher text and also identify the algorithm that provides optimal security and performance, thereby enhancing security against vulnerabilities and threats in today's digital landscape.
